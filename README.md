# Reverse String

## 6 ways and the best one

### How to reverse a string from the worst to the best

1. Using `for loop` and appending individual characters in verse order
2. Using `while loop` to iterate individual characters in reverse order and append those individual characters
3. Using string's `join()` built-in function with reversed()
4. Using `recursion`
5. Creating a `list` from string's built-in function and then reverse()
6. Using `slicing` to create a reverse copy of the string in reverse
